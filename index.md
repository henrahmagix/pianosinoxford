## James Street Tavern ~ [reviews](http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186361-d4494972-r193849394-The_James_Street_Tavern-Oxford_Oxfordshire_England.html)

Upright, tall. Through the front door, make a u-turn to your left.

### Condition

Good. In tune. One ivory chip.

The soft (felt) pedal doesn't work â€“ there are orange tubes inside that are attached to nothing. I think they should be holding the felt. If not, what are they for? Is it alive?

### Location

Off Cowley Road, turn down James Street, on the left.

47-48 James St, Oxford OX4 1EU

`51.747436, -1.237362`

## The Jam Factory ~ [site](http://www.thejamfactoryoxford.com/)

Upright, tall. Through the main entrance, in the area to the right.

### Condition

Very good. Well tuned and even action.

Soft (felt/practice) pedal is in the middle. It has a locking mechanism but that only softens the octave above middle C and a few other notes. Hold it down all the way to work across the whole keyboard. Not sure what the left pedal is meant to do but it doesn't work.

### Location

Frides Wide Square, south east corner.

## Far From The Madding Crowd ~ [site](http://www.maddingcrowd.co.uk/)

Thom Yorke has played this piano. Source: bartender at Chequers saw him play it in ~2009.

- G1#
- C2#
- D2

Between Gloucester Green and St Giles, past The White Rabbit pub.
