## The Jam Factory ~ [site](http://www.thejamfactoryoxford.com/)

Upright, tall. Through the main entrance, in the area to the right.

### Condition

Very good. Well tuned and even action.

Soft (felt) pedal is in the middle. It has a locking mechanism but that only softens the octave above middle C and a few other notes. Hold it down all the way to work across the whole keyboard.

### Location

Frides Wide Square, south east corner.

## Far From The Madding Crowd ~ [site](http://www.maddingcrowd.co.uk/)
